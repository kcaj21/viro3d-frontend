            We regard Viro3D as a work in progress. The 4,407 viruses included
            in phase one represent only a fraction of the virosphere and do not
            include any viruses of plants, bacteria or archaea. We anticipate
            expanding the Viro3D in the coming months and years. The structural
            models are derived from sequence annotations, which are sometimes
            incorrect and incomplete, and can come with outdated or
            non-informative labels. We have done our best to eliminate these
            problems but, inevitably, some remain. It is important to remember
            that the structures are predictions and need to be interpreted with
            care. Each model comes with confidence metrics (pLDDT and pTM) and
            are shown in the molecular viewer with residues colour-coded by
            pLDDT score. We welcome comments, feedback and suggestions. Please
